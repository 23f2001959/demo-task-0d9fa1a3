# Snake and Ladder Game

This project is a simple browser-based Snake and Ladder game implemented in a single HTML file. It includes all the necessary CSS and JavaScript inline to render a 10x10 game board, simulate two players, handle dice rolls, move player tokens, implement snake and ladder logic, display whose turn it is, detect the winner, and support a reset button.

## Setup
To run the game, simply download the HTML file and open it in a web browser.

## Usage
- Roll the dice by clicking on the "Roll Dice" button.
- Move the player tokens based on the dice roll.
- Climb ladders and slide down snakes when landing on their respective squares.
- The game will display whose turn it is and detect the winner once a player reaches the final square.
- Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Code Explanation
The HTML file contains the structure of the game board and player tokens. The CSS styles the game board and tokens, while the JavaScript handles the game logic. Player turns are determined using a simple toggle function, and dice rolls are generated randomly. Snakes and ladders are implemented using a predefined mapping of starting and ending squares.
